# LeetCode Practice

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode coding questions. It serves as a personal practice and learning resource for algorithmic problem-solving.

## Progress

I am actively solving LeetCode questions and updating my progress in this repository. Below is a summary of my progress so far:

- [x] **Easy Questions** - Completed 11 out of 100 questions
- [ ] **Medium Questions** - Completed 2 out of 150 questions
- [ ] **Hard Questions** - Completed 1 out of 50 questions

I will continue to update this progress section as I solve more LeetCode questions.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the difficulty level of the questions. Within each folder, you will find the solutions to individual problems. The file names are in the format `problem_name_problem_number.py`, and each file contains the solution code along with comments explaining the approach.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions and use them as a reference for your own learning and practice. You can browse the folders to find solutions for specific difficulty levels or search for a particular problem using its name.

Please note that while these solutions have worked for me and have passed on leetcode test cases/constraints, they may not be the most optimized or ideal solutions for all cases.

## Contributing

As this repository is for personal practice, contributions in the form of code submissions are not expected. However, if you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or reach out to me.
